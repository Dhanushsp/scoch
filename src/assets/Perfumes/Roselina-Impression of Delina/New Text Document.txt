Discription: Roselina – The Bloom of Modern Elegance

Indulge in a fragrance that whispers romance yet commands attention. Roselina is an exquisite interpretation of the iconic Delina — offering the same captivating charm at a price that makes luxury beautifully accessible.

Opening with sparkling notes of lychee, rhubarb, and bergamot, Roselina greets you with a burst of freshness that feels both playful and refined. At its heart, Turkish rose blooms in harmony with peony and lily-of-the-valley, creating a bouquet that’s irresistibly feminine. The base wraps you in cashmere-soft musk, creamy vanilla, and a hint of vetiver, leaving a trail as delicate as it is unforgettable.

Whether for an afternoon garden party or an intimate evening affair, Roselina lets you carry the elegance of French perfumery without the indulgent price tag.
